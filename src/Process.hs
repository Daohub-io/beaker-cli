-- |General interface for bytecode transformers.
--
-- Code can be in a number of states
--
--   1. @[OpCode]@ - A list of opcodes as parsed by the parser, fully static.
--   2. @[CountedOpCode]@ - The same list of opcodes as in #1, but each @OpCode@
--      is given an index of its starting location, beginning from one (this may
--      need to be zero). In this state, opcodes can be inserted, but will carry
--      an index of Nothing.
--   3. @[VarOpCode]@ - A list of opcodes that each might be either a normal
--      @CountedOpCode@ (@Just n@, or @Nothing@ as an index) or a @PushVar@ with
--      an integer indicating a value that will need to be inserted later (such
--      as the location of the jump table). These insertions are made by
--      @replaceVars@.

-- CODECOPY takes a length and a
-- byte offset from which to start copying code into memory. In order for a
-- contract to be created, bytecode is sent in a transaction. This bytecode is
-- then run *once*. This run should return a new bytecode, which is the bytecode
-- which forms the contract. To return code we need to use the RETURN opcode.
-- The return value is a section of memory indicated by a start offset an a
-- length, which are passed to the return opcode. RETURN is called with the
-- stack as follows.
--
-- @
--   TOP: 1. start_offset: the memory offset of the start of the return value.
--        2. length: the length of the return value in bytes
-- @
--
-- However, this requires that the final bytecode reside in memory. Therefore,
-- the code must be copied into memory. This is done via the CODECOPY opcode,
-- which takes a starting offset into the code, and a length, and copies that
-- length of code into a specified memory location. CODECOPY is called with the
-- stack as follows:
--
-- @
--   TOP: 1. start_mem_offest: The memory offset to start copying code to
--        2. code_start_offset: The bytecode offset to start copying code from
--        3. code_length: The length of code in bytes to be copied.
